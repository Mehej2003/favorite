    <p>Die With A Smile is the latest banger released by Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars. Bruno is following his own footsteps and carrying on towards a more soulful path. I am personally very pleased to see Lady Gaga hop on the same path and walk with Bruno, if only for a little while. There is a lot to say about Bruno Mars. How incredibly soulful his songwriting is, the raw power emanating from his voice and much more. I think this track shows that whatever you are going to compliment Bruno Mars for, you can just as well do the same for Lady Gaga.

        The two artists have figured out how to make their voices work together very well. In some ways, Lady Gaga’s voice provides soulful depth, while Bruno’s voice is cutting through like a Rasp, perfect drone. I think their voices match very well and whoever decided it was a good idea to put them together was right. Not only the separate sections sound good but also the parts where they harmonize.
        
        Bruno has been averting from his stylistic path for a little bit. The thing is, whatever this man does, he does not miss. A lot of artists who want to try different sounds become outcasts within their own audience. So a person could think that if Bruno Mars wanted to release a more grassroots soul, funk and RnB album, it would flop. He obviously proved these fictive people right. If you have not heard anything by Bruno since Grenade or Just The Way You Are, I suggest you go and listen to the entire “An Evening With Silk Sonic” album. Odds are you have already listened to the track “Leave The Door Open”, whether you agreed to it or not. If you hear this album, you will hear Bruno’s latest release in a whole new light. He is really pushing for a more organic blues/RnB/soul sound. 
        
        The track was produced by the legendary Dernst “D’Mile” Emile II”, or D’mile. He is the man who made the production for Leave The Door Open and it seems working with D’mile more or less guarantees you are going to make something magic. D’mile loves guitars, and I love D’mile. He frequently uses guitars in his production, both for melodies and rhythm. His sound is also shining through with the perfectly knocking drums, smooth groovy bassline, just enough space for the vocals and overall dreamy feel. If you want to hear more tracks made by D’mile, try listening to the entire album “Painted” by “Lucky Daye”. I swear you will find something there you enjoy. 
        
        In conclusion, this track is definitely worth a listen. It's hard to say exactly where it fits, though—play it in the car with friends, and the vibe might get a little too intense and melancholic. Put it on in a club, and it might not catch on with the crowd. However, this song shines as the perfect backdrop for a quiet, reflective moment, whether you’re alone or with someone special. It’s a sweet, romantic track that makes you appreciate the little things in life. I’m hoping to see more Lady Gaga collaborations, more soulful Bruno, and more of D'Mile's magic.
